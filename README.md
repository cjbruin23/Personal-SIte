## Tech Stack

Front-End:

- React library with Typescript, created with Vite
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for styling

Build chain tools:

- I have used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as the build tool for the project

Style Guide:

- For interface vs type in TS, I have decided to follow the heuristic of user interface, until we need to use the features of type.

Important Notes:

- If you are trying to push and getting an access rights error, make sure you are not on development or master. Pushing has been blocked from those branches
